# Sample-Portfolio

## Description

This repository is a showcase of my portfolio sample to show to possible future employers. To showcase my skill set in html and css when it comes to designing a webpage. I used html to start my webpage from scratch, later I added CSS to style my webpage. I used css grid and flex-box for positioning, pseudo selectors and media queries to further improve the ui of the webpage.
